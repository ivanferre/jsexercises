# JavaScript Events

Events are notable things in the DOM that JavaScript detects and can react to.

When an event occurs on a target element, a **handler** is executed.

It is possible to define the order of event handling across the DOM objects hierarchy, by taking advantage of the **event propagation**. See

The `removeEventListener` method will remove an event handler which was set using `addEventListener`.
